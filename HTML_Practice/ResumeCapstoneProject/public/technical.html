  <p>
    Additionally, I have built projects like an <b>Inventory Management System</b> using Spring Boot and ReactJS, which includes features for managing product stocks, quantities, and sales reports.<br />
    I also created a calculator-type web application and actively share my technical knowledge through tutorial videos on Spring Boot, AWS, and advanced Java concepts.
