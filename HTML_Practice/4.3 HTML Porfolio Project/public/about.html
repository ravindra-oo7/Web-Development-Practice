  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <hr />
  <p>
    I am a passionate Java Backend Developer with strong expertise in web application development, microservices architecture, and Spring Boot.<br />
    My technical repertoire includes a diverse set of programming languages and frameworks, such as Core Java, Advanced Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, SQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and RESTful APIs, alongside frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br /> 
    I also have experience with cloud services like AWS EC2, RDS, and Secrets Manager, and Redis caching for performance optimization.

    I recently completed a Post Graduate Diploma in Advanced Computing (PG-DAC), where I gained hands-on experience with C++, Core Java, Advanced Java, MySQL, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, NodeJS, .NET, C#, SDLC, and DSA.<br /> 
    My commitment to problem-solving is showcased through my consistent DSA practice and contributions to GitHub, highlighting my passion for coding and algorithmic thinking.

    During my internships, I worked on real-world projects that honed my skills in backend development and cloud deployment:
    </ul>
      <li>Java Developer Intern at HulkHire Tech Company: I developed microservices using Spring Boot for a US-based clientâ€™s e-commerce application, focusing on integrating PayPal as a payment service provider.</li>
      <li>Designed and implemented payment services, including secure PayPal order creation, for enterprise-level e-commerce solutions.</li>
      <li>Created comprehensive demo videos on Spring Boot Logging, Redis Integration, AWS RDS, and AWS Secrets Manager, showcasing my ability to explain complex technical concepts effectively.</li>
    <ul>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Additionally, I have built projects like an Inventory Management System using Spring Boot and ReactJS, which includes features for managing product stocks, quantities, and sales reports.<br />
    I also created a calculator-type web application and actively share my technical knowledge through tutorial videos on Spring Boot, AWS, and advanced Java concepts.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Outside of technical projects, I thrive in agile environments, leveraging tools like Jira and methodologies like Scrum.<br/>
    My commitment to learning, coupled with my practical experience, positions me to take on challenging roles in backend development and contribute to innovative IT solutions.
